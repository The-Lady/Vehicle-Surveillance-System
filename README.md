# Vehicle-Surveillance-System

### Introduction
The project aims to detect vehicles such as cars, trucks and bicycle in given images and track them in videos. The goal is achieved using YOLOv3 object detection model and PyTorch framework. The project contains a python file containing the YOLO model for detecting vehicles and a jupyter notebook which uses the model to display the output.

### Steps for running the project locally
1. Clone the repo via [URL](https://github.com/The-Lady/Vehicle-Surveillance-System.git)
2. Set up virtual environment:
    - Create virtual environment using command `virtualenv venv`
    - Activate the virtual environment *venv* environment
    - Install requirements using command `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Download the weights and configurations of YOLOv3
4. Open Jupyter Notebook in any of the following ways:
    - (via Terminal/Command Prompt/Anaconda terminal) Type the command `jupyter notebook`
    - (via Anaconda Navigator) Open Anaconda Navigator and click Jupyter Notebook
5. Run each cell
